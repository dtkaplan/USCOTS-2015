## Glyphs and Data

In its original sense, in archeology, a glyph is a carved symbol.

Heiro**glyph** | Mayan **glyph**

## Data Glyph

A data glyph is also a mark, but one that encodes the value of variables.  

EXAMPLES HERE error bars, dots, bars.

## Data Glyph Properties: Aesthetics

Definition of aethetic in the original sense

dots: x, y, color, size, shape, ...
bars: x, ybottom, ytop, color, ...
error bars: x, ycenter, ytop, ybottom, ...
Give some examples of aesthetics for one of the glyphs exemplified above.

## Glyph-Ready Data

Glyph-ready data has this form:

* There is one row for each data glyph to be drawn. 
* The variables are those that make up the features of the glyph.

### The Goal of Data Wrangling

* Get your data into glyph-ready form.
* "Glyph-ready" is also model-ready, descriptive-stats ready, and so on.

## Graphics syntax in base graphics, lattice, ...

```r
xyplot(y ~ x, data=your_data_table)

## The rest.

* Data tables have rows and columns: cases and variables
* Glyph-ready data 

1. Some grammar [DTK, 15 min]
    * Frame
    * Glyph
    * Aesthetic (graphical property)
    * Glyph-ready data
#. Map variables to aesthetics with `mScatter()`,  `mDistribution()`, `mBar()` (`mWorldMap()`)  [note: lattice graphics with `mPlot()`]
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
require(DCF)
require(DCFinteractive)
DCFinteractive::mScatter( your_data_frame )   


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
