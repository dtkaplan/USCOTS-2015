    * [R 3.1.1 or more recent](http://cran.rstudio.com/)
    * [RStudio preview edition](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)    
    or, alternatively
    * Login credentials for the RStudio server being used for this workshop. DRAFT: NEED LINK [More info about the server]()

* Open up **communal notes** for workshop. [Link to Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XEYhUZj9C468VRAl_SoGuUHL5UVtz0JU6PF5iCPuE6c/edit?usp=sharing) Add comments and questions as the workshop progresses.
* Participant **skill survey** (for forming teams). [Link to survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zQBF_3PIs7OHLn9srhr5odgqL0p9yxsi8OjnmqRk43k/viewform). After you press "submit", you'll see a page with a link to "Edit your response." Open that in your browser and **leave it open** so that you can fill in your team name when you have formed it.

### Welcome! 

1. Brief review of setup and plans [DTK, 10 min]
2. Introduce your neighbors, and form teams for later. Two to four people per team, with nice mix of skills. Give your team a name so that we can refer to it. [15 min]

## RStudio

Quick introduction to RStudio [NJH, 20 min]
    
* Give these commands to open our template file in the editor.
    ```r
library(DCF)
editWebFile("http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/datasets/DCF/USCOTS-01.Rmd")
```
* Save it to your own directory.
* Compile it to HTML.
* Publish it. RPubs ID: USCOTS-2015  Password: Written on board. <!-- benchtree -->

## Visualization Quick Start

1. Data frames.  We'll work with ones from `mosaicData`, `NHANES` and `DCF` to begin with. Variables and cases. Quick summaries: `glimpse()`, `nrow()`, `names()`
#. Some grammar [DTK, 15 min]
    * Frame
    * Glyph
    * Aesthetic (graphical property)
    * Glyph-ready data
#. Map variables to aesthetics with `mScatter()`, `mBar()`, `mDistribution()`, `mWorldMap()`
    ```r
devtools::install_github("dtkaplan/DCFinteractive")
DCFinteractive::mScatter( your_data_frame )   
```
#. Activity: Visualizing a data frame
    * Construct a visualization of variables in a data frame.
    * Cut and paste the corresponding `ggplot2` command as a chunk into your Rmd file. 
    * Publish to RPubs (user ID: USCOTS-2015)
#. [Data visualization cheat sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) as handout, or follow the link.

## Wrangling Quick Start

1. Minimal R [DTK, 5 min] THE SLIDES WILL GO HERE.
    * data frames
    * functions and arguments
    * piping
#. Wrangling data verbs vs reduction verbs vs transformation verbs. [DTK, 10 min] THESE WILL BE A FEW SLIDES.  REFER TO THE CHEAT SHEET.
#. Activity: What happened to Mary and Jane? [DTK, 15 min] THIS WILL BE USCOTS-02.Rmd
    * `filter()`, piping, `select()`, `arrange()`
    * filter by name, by sex, by year range.
    * `group_by()` and `summarise()`
        * Add up selected names over the years.
        * How many babies in each year?
        * How many distinct names in each year?
        * Entropy?
#. Convert USCOTS-02.Rmd to be some names of interest to you. Publish to RPubs. [20 min]
