## Workshop Times

* Wednesday May 27: 8:30am - 4:00pm
    Morning and afternoon sessions with a break for lunch (participants are on their own for lunch).
* Thursday May 28: 8:30am - 12:00pm
    Morning session only

## Prior to the Wednesday start. 

Come a bit before the official 8:30 am start to get help with these.

* Making sure you have access to the software.
    * [**R 3.1.1** or more recent](http://cran.rstudio.com/) as well as [**RStudio** preview edition](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)    
    or, alternatively,
    * use a web browser to access the RStudio **server** being provided for this workshop at <http://macalester.edu/rstudio>.  You will need login credentials which will be provided at the start of the workshop. (N.B., this server will be available only for the duration of USCOTS 2015.  We will show you how to preserve your files for later use on another system.)
    
    
    Whichever way you access R and RStudio, please
    
    * update and install additional packages, by executing these lines in the R console in RStudio:
        ```{r eval=FALSE}
update.packages()
install.packages(c("devtools", "mosaic", "tidyr", "dplyr", "ggvis", "rmarkdown", "shiny", "haven", "mosaicData", "manipulate", "babynames", "nycflights13", "wordcloud", "tm"))
devtools::install_github("ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic", ref="beta")
devtools::install_github("dtkaplan/DCF")
devtools::install_github("dtkaplan/DCFinteractive")
```

* Open up **communal notes** for workshop. [Link to Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XEYhUZj9C468VRAl_SoGuUHL5UVtz0JU6PF5iCPuE6c/edit?usp=sharing) Add comments and questions as the workshop progresses.
* Participant **skill survey** (for forming teams). [Link to survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zQBF_3PIs7OHLn9srhr5odgqL0p9yxsi8OjnmqRk43k/viewform). After you press "submit", you'll see a page with a link to "Edit your response." Open that in your browser and **leave it open** so that you can fill in your team name when you have formed it.

## Workshop outline

### Welcome! 

1. [Goals, topics, set-up](../DataScienceWorkshop/welcome.html) <!-- [DTK and NJH, 10 min] -->
2. Introduce your neighbors, and form teams for workshop activities. [Follow the instructions, here.](form_teams.html) Two to three people per team, with a nice mix of skills. Give your team a name so that we can refer to it. [15 min]

### RStudio Quick Start

* mosaic resources
* panes, tabs, console 
* Lead through opening a project.  open a project
* loading packages, install if necessary
* bringing in data from a package
* Data frames.  We'll work with ones from `mosaicData`, `DCF`, and `nycflights13` to begin with. Variables and cases. Quick summaries: `glimpse()`, `nrow()`, `names()`, `head()`
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
require(nycflights13)
glimpse(flights)
names(airplanes)
names(airlines)
names(airports)
```

### Visualization Quick Start

* [Glyphs and Glyph-ready Data](../DataScienceWorkshop/VisualizationQuickStart.html)
* Activity: Deconstructing graphics. Pick any one: [one](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G1.pdf), [two](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G2.pdf), [three](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G3.pdf), [four](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G4.pdf), [five](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G5.pdf), [six](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G6.pdf), [seven](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G7.pdf), [eight](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G8.pdf), [nine](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G9.pdf), [ten](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G10.pdf), [eleven](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G11.pdf), [twelve](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G11.pdf), [thirteen](../Handouts/DeconstructingGraphics/G13.pdf) <!-- These are from DCF-2015/Book/Worksheets -->
* Using `mScatter()` [notes](../DataScienceWorkshop/mScatter.Rmd) 
    
### R Markdown Quick Start

1. Quick intro to R Markdown and reproducible analysis [Prezi](https://prezi.com/e7wtfnacj9ub/intro-to-r-markdown/) [NJH, 10 min]
2. Activity (visualization redux): Give these commands to open our template file in the editor.
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(
  "http://dtkaplan.github.io/USCOTS-2015/Handouts/USCOTS-01.Rmd",
  dest="USCOTS-01.Rmd")
file.edit("USCOTS-01.Rmd")
```
3. Add a command to generate a visualization (using the output of `Show Expression` above).
4. Compile it to HTML.
4. Publish it. RPubs ID: USCOTS-2015  Password: Written on board. <!-- benchtree -->
    * Cut and paste the corresponding `ggplot2` command from `Show Expression` output in `mplot()` as a chunk into your Rmd file. 
    * Publish to RPubs (user ID: USCOTS-2015)
#. [Data visualization cheat sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) as handout, or follow the link.

### Wrangling Quick Start

1. [Notes](../DataScienceWorkshop/WranglingQuickStart.html)
2. Practice with data verbs and `dplyr`: [An interactive app](http://rstudio.calvin.edu:3838/rpruim/dataOps/)
    * Tasks: [NEED TO BE POSTED, DTK]
#. Activity: [What happened to Mary and Jane?](../Handouts/WhatHappenedToJane/WhatHappenedToJane.html) Download and edit the template:
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(
  "http://dtkaplan.github.io/USCOTS-2015/Handouts/WhatHappenedToJane/WhatHappenedToJane.Rmd",
  dest="WhatHappenedToJane.Rmd")
file.edit("WhatHappenedToJane.Rmd")
```
    The answers are [here](../Handouts/WhatHappenedToJane/WhatHappenedToJane-answers.html)
#. [Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

### Mini case study: Bike sharing

Simple to moderately complicated data wrangling tasks in the context of bike rentals in thw Washington, DC area. For quick browsing, here's the [HTML file](../Handouts/BikeSharing/BikeSharingBasics.html).  But work with the `.Rmd` as shown.

1. Download and edit the `.Rmd` template file. Copy and paste these commands into your R console. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(
  "http://dtkaplan.github.io/USCOTS-2015/Handouts/BikeSharing/BikeSharingBasics.Rmd", 
  dest="BikeSharingBasics.Rmd")
file.edit("BikeSharingBasics.Rmd")
```
2. Make sure to compile the unchanged file to HTML.  It's best to start with a working document then add small changes, recompile, fix errors as required, add more small changes, recompile, and so on.


### Macro case study: Airline flights database

activity: work in groups to do something with dplyr?  (provide scaffolding with stubbed out Rmd file perhaps using nycflights13 [NJH]  (join) plus more practice  (20 minutes)

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(
  "http://dtkaplan.github.io/USCOTS-2015/Handouts/USCOTS-flights.Rmd",
  dest="USCOTS-flights.Rmd")
file.edit("USCOTS-flights.Rmd")
```

### Data Scraping Quick Start

* [The basics](../DataScienceWorkshop/ScrapingAndCleaning.Rmd)(20 minutes)
* [Scraping nuclear reactors](../Handouts/Project_NuclearReactors.pdf)
* APIs and gateways.

Other sources of data. Something easy they can do: NYC open data, CDC.  At the level of downloading CSV files. [DTK to find example from Data Computing book.]  Bike sharing? Restaurants?  Scaffold 70% for them and have them do one. Difference between source API and what you write in R. [30 min work, 10 min presentation]

### Shiny and dynamic graphics

* brief introduction to Shiny via Markdown [NJH] (10 minutes)
* Activity: customize a default shiny file.  [DTK, 30 min]
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("http://dtkaplan.github.io/USCOTS-2015/Handouts/USCOTS-Shiny.Rmd",
              dest="USCOTS-Shiny.Rmd")
file.edit("USCOTS-Shiny.Rmd")
```

### On your own

1. Maps
    * Make a choropleth map. `mWorldMap()`, `mUSMap()`  [DTK] From Data Computing example
    * Leaflet bicycle map
2. An [idea for an applied probability project](../Handouts/WhatHappenedToJane/AppliedProbabilityProject.html).


### Models and Machine Learning: for self study

Link to Danny's notes WILL GO HERE  [DTK]

* glyph-ready is also model-ready [DTK]
* lm() glm()
* “machine learning”
* unsupervised: car data clustering
* supervised: CART

### Text mining 101: for self study [NJH]

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(
  "http://dtkaplan.github.io/USCOTS-2015/Handouts/USCOTS-text.Rmd",
  dest="USCOTS-text.Rmd")
file.edit("USCOTS-text.Rmd")
```

### Framing Statistical Questions with Data Science

#### Discussion:

1. Your ideas for how you might use this material in your own teaching.
2. What support do you need moving forward?

#### Examples: 

* Stat 101 .....
* Modeling ..... <!-- bicycles and the distance from downtown and the distance between stations.
restaurant inspections and conditional probability -->
* Probability .....
