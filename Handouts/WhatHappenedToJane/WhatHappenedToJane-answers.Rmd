## Warm-ups


### 1. How many babies are represented?

Add up the `count` over the names and years.  

```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count)) 
```

Note that `summarise()` clobbers all the variables in the input data table other than those used for grouping. (No variables were used for grouping here.)


### 2. How many babies are there in each year?

```{r}
BabyNames %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(count)) 
```

With `year` made a grouping variable, a separate calculation is done for each year, and `year` appears in the output.

### 3. How many distinct names in each year?

```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(name_count = n_distinct(name))
```

### 4. How many distinct names of each sex in each year?

```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  summarise(name_count = n_distinct(name))
```

## Popularity of Jane and Mary

### 1. Track the yearly number of Janes and Marys over the years.

```{r}
Result <-
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) %>% 
  group_by(name, year) %>% # for each year
  summarise(count = sum(count))
```

### 2. Plot out the result of (1)

Put `year` on the x-axis and the count of each name on the y-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(data=Result, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_point()
```

* *Map* the name (Mary or Jane) to the aesthetic of color.  Remember that mapping to aesthetics is always done inside the `aes()` function.
* Instead of using dots as the glyph, use a line that connects consecutive values: `geom_line()`.
* Change the y-axis label to "Yearly Births": `+ ylab("Yearly Births")`
* *Set* the line thickness to `size=2`. Remember that "setting" refers to adjusting the value of an aesthetic to a constant.  Thus, it's *outside* the `aes()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(data=Result, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = name), size=2) +
  ylab("Yearly Births")
```

### 3. Look at the *proportion* of births rather than the count

```{r}
Result2 <-
  BabyNames %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Mary", "Jane")) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / total)
```

* Why is `sex` a variable in `Result2`? Eliminate it, keeping just the girls.
    ```{r}
Result2 <-
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(sex == "F") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Mary", "Jane")) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / total)        
```

* What happens if the `filter()` step is put *before* the `mutate()` step?

The `total` is just for Mary and Jane, ignoring all the other babies.

* Graph the results
```{r}
ggplot(data=Result2, aes(x = year, y = proportion)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = name), size=2) +
  ylab("Yearly Births")
```

* Add a vertical line to mark a year in which something happened that might relate to the increase or decrease the popularity of the name.  Example: The movie [*Whatever Happened to Baby Jane*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Ever_Happened_to_Baby_Jane%3F_%281962_film%29) came out in 1962.  The glyph is a vertical line: `geom_vline()`.
  
```{r}
ggplot(data=Result2, aes(x = year, y = proportion)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = name), size=2) +
  ylab("Yearly Births") +
  geom_vline(x=1962)
```
