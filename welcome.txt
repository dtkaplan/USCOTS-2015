Dear USCOTS Workshop Participants,            May 21, 2015
 
You are receiving this message because you are listed as being registered for "Basics of Data Science in R and R-Studio".  We are looking forward to having you at our workshop next week at USCOTS. 


This is a 1.5 day workshop, Wednesday, May 27 that starts @ 8:30 a.m. (full day) and May 28 @ 8:30 a.m. (half day, ending at noon) (unfortunately, the workshop does not provide lunch) 

Abstract: This workshop is intended to provide an introduction to data science tools and approaches for instructors with a background in R. The goal is to help identify key capacities for instructors and students to "think with data" while answering a statistical question. Key topics will include data wrangling (operations to get data in the right form for graphics), reproducibility, web-scraping, and constructing static and dynamic graphics from data. Suggested background: some background using or teaching with R.


Some advance work on your part will help to make the workshop more effective.  We would appreciate it if you could do the following steps:

(1) complete the (brief) pre-workshop survey at:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zQBF_3PIs7OHLn9srhr5odgqL0p9yxsi8OjnmqRk43k/viewform

(2) (re)install R and RStudio with some additional add-on packages

You'll need to:

install or update R (3.1.1 or later): http://cran.r-project.org/
install the Preview release of RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/

run the commands:

update.packages() 
install.packages(c("devtools", "mosaic", "tidyr", "dplyr", "ggvis", "rmarkdown", "shiny", "haven", "mosaicData", "manipulate", "babynames", "nycflights13")) 
devtools::install_github("ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic", ref="beta") 
devtools::install_github("dtkaplan/DCF") devtools::install_github("dtkaplan/DCFinteractive")


We plan to have participants use the tools and approaches that we will be describing.  So it will be very helpful for you to prepare a laptop in advance.  (We will also be making temporary accounts available on a cloud-based RStudio server: please contact me if you won't have a laptop and would like to get started with this in advance.)


Again, we look forward to meeting/seeing you at Penn State.  If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to email us at nhorton@amherst.edu or Daniel Kaplan <dtkaplan@gmail.com>

Nick and Danny
